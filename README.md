# CSCI 002 - Programming Concepts and Methodology II

This repository contains assignments and projects from **CSCI 002**, the second course in the computer science sequence.

## Course Description

CSCI 002 advances C++ programming skills from CSCI 001, emphasizing **data structures**, **object-oriented programming**, and **software engineering** principles for designing and implementing larger programs.

### Key Topics

- Fundamental data structures: arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees; pointers, references, memory allocation, runtime management
- Recursion: iterative vs. recursive solutions, divide-and-conquer, backtracking
- Declarations, scope, lifetime, type checking, reference counting vs. garbage collection
- Abstraction: functions, iterators, templates, parameterization, modules
- Object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, class hierarchies, method tables
- Software engineering: design principles, object-oriented vs. structured analysis and design

## Repository Contents

- Programming assignments and solutions
- Projects demonstrating data structures and OOP
- Code examples and documentation

This repository documents my work in intermediate C++ programming, data structures, and object-oriented development.
